# DiscordLevelUpBot
People have created bots for discord that give users points when they speak, this shows on a leader board, as I wanted to be on the leaderboard but didn't want to speak the whole time I figured out how to abuse them, they give points for text typed for each minute, spamming the chat with thousands of individual messages was my first approach, I then discovered the best method was to send a word every minute, the score gains for both approaches were the same, I then coded this project to send a single word per minute from the Lord of the Rings script (:    I am number 1 on the leader, my closest competitor has 20000 times less points than me.
